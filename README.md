# Digital Library

All standard book readers want to easily keep track of what books they have taken from the library and to be able to return them within certain deadlines. Each book has a unique QR code or barcode. When a book is checked out, the library system adds this book to the user's profile. We aim to develop an iOS application to help users. They will be able to check if a book is part of their list (if they need to return it), request certain books, and be reminded when they need to return the books. Each book has a cover photo, code, short description, title, publisher, author, year, and ISBN. The application presents statistics for all checked books by time, genre, and author.
