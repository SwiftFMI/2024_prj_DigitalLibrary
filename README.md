# Digital Library

All standard books readers want to easily keep track of what books they have taken from the library and to be able to return them within certain deadlines. Each book has a unique qrcode or barcode. When a book is checked out, the library system adds this book the user's profile. Our aim is to develop an iOS application to help users. They will be able to check if a book is part of their list (if they need to return it), to request certain books, be reminded when you need to return the books. Each book has a cover photo, code, short description, title, publisher, author, year and isbn. The application presents statistics for all checked books by time, by genre, by author.

## Technical elements
- Firebase - used for Library database; should have at least 20 books; should have basic functionality of book registration and potentially user registration
- Qrcode or isbn scan
- SwiftUI Chart module - used for the statistics
- Data filtration by certain characteristics wherever searching is needed
