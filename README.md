# Digital Library

All standard book readers want to easily keep track of what books they have taken from the library and to be able to return them within certain deadlines. Each book has a unique QR code or barcode. When a book is checked out, the library system adds this book to the user's profile. We aim to develop an iOS application to help users. They will be able to check if a book is part of their list (if they need to return it), request certain books, and be reminded when they need to return the books. Each book has a cover photo, code, short description, title, publisher, author, year, and ISBN. The application presents statistics for all checked books by time, genre, and author.

## Technical elements
- Firebase - used for Library database
- Barcode scanning - user for extraction the book's ISBN
- SwiftUI Chart module - used for the Statistics
- Data filtration by certain characteristics wherever searching is needed

## Dictionary
- **ISBN**: The International Standard Book NumberÂ (ISBN) is a numeric commercial book identifier that is intended to be unique.

## Additional features
- **Sign up/Sign in**: The application allows user to create their profiles that are connected to the Library database.
- **Profile picture**: Every user has a default profile picture but easily can change it by choosing one from the gallery of the phone.
- **Remember me**: On login, users can use the "Remember me" functionality, so that they don't have to go through the login process every time they open the app.
- **Dark theme**: The application supports a dark theme for every screen, corresponding to the settings of the phone.
